                    <p class="faq-answer">Just about any role you need on a jobsite or in the office. We place skilled tradespeople (carpenters, electricians, plumbers, HVAC techs, equipment operators, etc.), site supervisors and foremen, project managers, estimators – even hard-to-find specialists. Because we focus on the construction industry, we likely already know candidates in the trade you're hiring for. If it's related to building, we can find the talent.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">How fast can you get someone on our site?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Lightning-fast compared to hiring on your own. Thanks to our ready pool of pre-vetted candidates, we can often present you with a qualified person within 48 hours to a few days (sometimes even faster for common labor roles). We know every day counts on a project – our goal is to keep your jobsites fully crewed without missing a beat in your schedule.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">What if a worker isn't the right fit or doesn't show up?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">We stand by our talent. If any placement isn't working out or a person flakes (rare, but it can happen), let us know immediately. We'll quickly address the issue – whether that means replacing them with someone just as skilled or finding a solution that keeps your project moving. You're never left on your own to deal with it. Our reputation rides on delivering reliable, ready-to-work people every time, so we'll make it right.</p>
