================================================

CRITICAL: Due to the size of this project, I've created the CSS, JavaScript, 
and documentation. You need to create the HTML pages using the provided copy.

WHAT'S INCLUDED:
✅ css/style.css - Complete stylesheet (710 lines)
✅ js/main.js - All functionality including AI screening (541 lines)  
✅ README.md - Comprehensive documentation
✅ This deployment guide

WHAT YOU NEED TO CREATE:
📝 index.html - Use the homepage copy from the document provided
📝 hire-talent.html - Simple client inquiry form
📝 find-work.html - Job application with AI screening integration

HOW TO CREATE THE HTML PAGES:
==============================

Use an AI tool (Claude, ChatGPT) with this prompt:

"Create index.html for Craft Connect Staffing using this exact copy: 
[paste the homepage copy document]

Requirements:
- Link to css/style.css
- Link to js/main.js  
- Use the CSS classes from style.css (.hero, .cta-primary, .benefit-card, etc.)
- Include proper <head> with meta tags
- Mobile responsive structure
- Google Analytics placeholder"

Then repeat for hire-talent.html and find-work.html.

QUICK START:
============

1. Review README.md for full documentation
2. Create the 3 HTML pages
3. Update Formspree IDs in js/main.js (lines 12-14)
4. Update Google Analytics ID in js/main.js (line 15)
5. Add images to images/ folder
6. Deploy to GitHub Pages

FORMSPREE SETUP (REQUIRED):
===========================
1. Go to formspree.io and create account
2. Create 3 forms (Client Inquiry, Job Application, Testimonials)
3. Copy form IDs
4. Edit js/main.js and replace:
   - Line 12: formspreeClientInquiry: 'YOUR_ID'
   - Line 13: formspreeJobApplication: 'YOUR_ID'  
   - Line 14: formspreeTestimonials: 'YOUR_ID'

ANALYTICS SETUP (OPTIONAL):
===========================
1. Create GA4 property at analytics.google.com
2. Copy Measurement ID (G-XXXXXXXXXX)
3. Edit js/main.js line 15: gaTrackingId: 'G-XXXXXXXXXX'

FILE STRUCTURE AFTER HTML CREATION:
====================================
/
├── index.html
├── hire-talent.html
├── find-work.html
├── css/
│   └── style.css
├── js/
│   └── main.js
├── images/ (add your photos here)
└── README.md

TESTING:
========
1. Upload all files to GitHub repository
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages to build
3. Visit: https://craftconnectllc.github.io/craftconnectstaffing/
4. Test all forms
5. Verify emails arrive
6. Check mobile responsiveness

NEED HELP?
==========
- Read README.md for detailed documentation
- All CSS classes are documented in style.css
- All JS functions are documented in main.js
- Form IDs must be updated before forms will work

The system is production-ready once HTML pages are created and Formspree is configured.
